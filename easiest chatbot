  Chatterbot

ChatterBot is a Python library that makes it easy to generate automated responses to a userâ€™s input. ChatterBot uses a selection of machine learning algorithms to produce different types of responses. This makes it easy for developers to create chat bots and automate conversations with users.

Example1 
In this example with the help of chatterbot we can make calculations and also find the current time.

CODE-
from chatterbot import ChatBot
bot = ChatBot(
    'Math & Time Bot',
    logic_adapters=[
        'chatterbot.logic.MathematicalEvaluation',
        'chatterbot.logic.TimeLogicAdapter'
    ]
)

# Print an example of getting one math based response
response = bot.get_response('What is 4 + 9?')
print(response)

# Print an example of getting one time based response
response = bot.get_response('What time is it?')
print(response)
